# P5JS  sketch showcase

[Github Pages](https://jaydeep-p.github.io/p5-Showcase/)

This website was made to show p5 sketches with a preview image, this is much more impressive than the stock p5js sketch list. 

## Technologies used

NextJS, Static site generation, p5js.


## Usage

To add new sketches, you only need to edit the sketchData.json file in the root folder, if you want to make this dynamic, replace the static file with a database request.

## Scope for Improvement
As mentioned above, the static nature of this project allows it to be hosted on Github, however, this can be replaced with a server that can handle multiple users and sketches.

### About
I made this website as a successor to my old website that was made using plain HTML and CSS. I have used NextJs for this website, primary reason for doing so was to automate the page generation (Which I had to do by hand on the older version).

###### This is also my first ever project using NextJs, please forgive any of my bad practices.
